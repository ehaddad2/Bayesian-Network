Project Description:

This project uses the provided implementation of a Bayesian network to perform exact and approximate inference on given networks stored in .XMLBIF files. This README file provides instructions on how to build and run the Pawntastic project. Please follow the guidelines below to get started.

Instructions:
1. To build the project, navigate to the main directory titled as: "Bayesian Network".

2. Compile the Java source files using the following command: javac Program.java

3. Then, to run the program, use the following command: java Program.java

4. Finally, the REPL will begin and you can apply any of the 3 inference algorithms you'd like on any XMLBIF encoded network!
